Regarding packages/ports/emerges/etc
------------------------------------

CRITICAL:  if you are using a "package"/"emerge"/"port" of getmail, DO NOT
REPORT PROBLEMS TO ME if that package makes changes to the original getmail
code; if the package includes patches or other changes to the getmail code,
report the problem to your OS vendor or packager -- only they can help you with
problems introduced by their packaging of getmail.

If you're not sure whether the package you're using is an unmodified version of
getmail, I can help you determine that.  Make sure to include a URL to the
package you installed in your email.

To packagers: feel free to contact me regarding your packaging of getmail, and
any issues you might have with getmail as I distribute it.  If you think
changes to getmail are necessary for your package, let's discuss it -- maybe
the changes you want would be good for all getmail users, and I can integrate
them into the trunk.  If you *do* distribute a modified version of getmail,
please make a good-faith effort at ensuring that anyone using your package
knows that the version you distribute differs from mine, and the reasons for
the changes.

Before reporting a problem
--------------------------

If you want to report a getmail problem to me, please ensure

  -you are running the latest version of getmail from the
  website at http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/

  -you have installed getmail from the .tar.gz file I provide

Then follow the rest of the instructions below.
